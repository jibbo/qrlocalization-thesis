People who don't have the requirements to experience properly this new places begin to feel unsafe and perceive the world around even with hostility, which brings them confined in buildings they know and trust.
A subset of these people are elders who experience difficulties especially in complex and overcrowded environments and, in this field, the project operates, in order to improve their quality of living by allowing an old person to get out of their domestic walls without the help of a care-giver.
Therefore this could dramatically impact the psychological attitude of a person towards the world leading to a boost in general health.
