\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I would like to thank my supervisors Luigi Palopoli and Federico Moro who helped me every time I had fallen during the writing of the algorithm.
\\
Many thanks to David Macii whose support and guidance was very helpful.
\\ \\
My gratitude goes also to my girlfriend Giulia, my family and my roommate Federico who all were there for me in dark moments.
\\ \\
In addition, I am pleased to acknowledge all the friends who stayed at my side in these three years:
Giulio Fornasaro, Luca Zamboni and Roberto Zen but also Andrea Cristiano, Andrea Panizza and Lorenzo Lotto with all the other course mates, because, without them, this time would have been more boring.
