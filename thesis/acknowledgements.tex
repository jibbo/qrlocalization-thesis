\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I would like to thank my supervisor Luigi Palopoli for his guidance during the work I've created.
\\
Special thanks are for Federico Moro who helped me every time I had fallen when I was writing the algorithm.
\\
Many thanks also to David Macii whose support was very helpful.
\\ \\
My gratitude goes to my girlfriend Giulia, my family and Federico Spada who helped me in dark moments.
\\
I am pleased to acknowledge all the friends who stayed at my side in these three years:
Giulio Fornasaro, Luca Zamboni, Roberto Zen, Andrea Cristiano, Andrea Panizza and Lorenzo lotto but also all my course mates, without them this time would have been boring.
