I would like to thank my supervisors Luigi Palopoli and Federico Moro who helped me every time I had fallen during the writing of the algorithm.
\\
Many thanks to David Macii whose support and guidance was very helpful.
\\ \\
Thanks to my family for all the support and encouragement.
\\
My gratitude goes to my girlfriend Giulia and my roommate Federico who all were there for me in dark moments, thanks for being there.
\\ 
I am pleased to acknowledge all the friends who stayed at my side in these three years and my course mates, in particular:
Giulio Fornasaro, Luca Zamboni and Roberto Zen but also Andrea Cristiano, Andrea Panizza and Lorenzo Lotto, because, without them, this time wouldn't be worth an half of what it was worth.
